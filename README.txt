This release allows performing a combined Principal Component Analysis followed by a Hierarchical Clustering on Principle Components (HCPC) on a quantitative data set and map the results.
The test data is Data_India.txt, a specially conceived geographic database of 55 indicators, covering issues of economic activity, urban structure, socio-demographic development, 
consumption levels, infrastructure endowment and  basic geographical positioning within the Indian space and at the district level. Data refer to 2011 or to 2001-2011 evolutions.
A shapefile of the Indian district is attached allowing to map the results.

v.1.1 contains
- R Script (PCA HCPC.R)
- Data set (Data_India.txt)
- Archive of shapefiles for the Indian districts of 2011 (District_2011.zip)
- Graphical outputs for PCA and HCPC
- README.txt
